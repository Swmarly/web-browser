Checks that each RuntimeFeature gated mojo method used for glic has a
corresponding '// MOJO_RUNTIME_FEATURE_GATED' comment where that method
is excluded from the public API.

Calling RuntimeFeature gated methods when the feature is not enabled
will result in a closed mojo pipe, putting Glic in an unusable state.
This check helps reduce the risk for accidentally calling such methods.

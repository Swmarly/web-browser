Without the “your”, it could sound like Chrome is simply building a generic library of interests. * “estimated”: It’s an “estimation”, and we don’t want to suggest that we know with certainty the user’s interests. Avoid words like “guess”, “establish”, “define”, etc. (in place of “estimate”). * “by Chrome”: This is new behavior for a browser (Chrome) to take an active role in processing user data for the purposes of showing ads.

# FFmpeg Tips & Tricks

## Performing a Roll `Updated [10/15/2025]`
This is a long and arduous journey. Please visit [go/robosushi](go/robosushi)
the long-form documentation.

Note: we might be better served by the documentation living in the tree along
side the scripts in order to best prevent stale instructions.

## Upstreaming Your Patch(es) `Updated [10/15/2025]`

### Using `git send-email`
1. Visit [app-passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
and create a new app named `git-send-email`.

2. SAVE THIS PASSWORD. You can't view it again once you hide it.

3. Set up your git configuration - in `~/.gitconfig` you should include:
  ```
  [sendemail]
    smtpencryption = tls
    smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
    smtpuser = [username]@chromium.org
    smtpserverport = 587
  ```
 - `@google.com` addresses should work fine as well.
 - You _can_ save the password here using `smtppass = aaaa bbbb cccc dddd`
(but don't tell big brother)

4. Check out a totally fresh, upstream copy of ffmpeg:
`git clone https://git.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.git`

5. Apply your patch, commit it, and view the upstream instructions for testing
and formatting your patch
[here](https://ffmpeg.org/developer.html#Submitting-patches-1).

6. Send your patch. This will ask you for the password from steps 1&2.
 - `git send-email --confirm=auto --to=ffmpeg-devel@ffmpeg.org --annotate HEAD^`

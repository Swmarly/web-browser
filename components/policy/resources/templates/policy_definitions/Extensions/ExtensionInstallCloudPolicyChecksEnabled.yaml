caption: Enables additional cloud policy checks to allow/block installation of extensions.
default: false
desc: |-
  This policy incidates to browsers that they need to perform additional checks for extensions such as checking if an extension is in a category blocked by administrator.

  This policy will automatically be set to Enabled if any rules are configured in the <ph name="GOOGLE_ADMIN_CONSOLE_PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Admin console</ex></ph>,
  and will be Disabled otherwise.

  When this policy is set to Enabled, it signals to <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> that it needs to consult the Cloud service to determine if an extension should be blocked.
  This policy check is performed for new installations and on all currently installed extensions, both at startup and periodically.

  When this policy is set to Disabled, this signals to <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> that it does not need to perform any additional checks
  to determine if an extension should be blocked based on enterprise rules defined in the <ph name="GOOGLE_ADMIN_CONSOLE_PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Admin console</ex></ph>.

  If the extension is not allowed, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will block the installation. For already installed extensions, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will disable them.

  Chrome policies will take precedence over this policy such as if the extension is in <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_ALLOWLIST_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionInstallAllowlist</ph>, <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_BLOCKLIST_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionInstallBlocklist</ph>,
  or <ph name="EXTENSION_INSTALL_FORCED_POLICY_NAME">ExtensionInstallForced</ph>.

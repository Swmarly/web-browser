// SuggestionGenerator is an interface that is used to generate suggestions for
// a specific `FillingProduct`. Each `FillingProduct` has their own
// implementation of the `SuggestionGenerator` interface.
//
// Generating suggestions consists of two phases:
// 1. All generators are called to fetch the data that is going to be used for
//    creating the suggestions. No assumptions should be made about the order
//    of those calls and some of those calls will be asynchronous.
// 2. Every generator is called again with the data that was fetched for all
//    `FillingProduct`s in step 1, and uses that to generate the suggestions
//    for its specific `FillingProduct`.
//
// Note: Some product suggestions depend on the data from other products.
// E.g. PlusAddresses and Address suggestions needs the data from both
// products, before being able to generate suggestions.
//
// Because of the dependency for each suggestion generator to know about the
// data from other FillingProducts, the generation is split into two phases. The
// second phase is only executed if the first phase finished for all
// `FillingProduct`s. Within each phase there is no guarantee about the order in
// which the suggestion generators are called.

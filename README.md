# Kona Browser

A cozy, anime-inspired single-page web browser concept dedicated to Konata Izumi. It features:

- A pastel starry interface with day/night themes
- Dynamic tab simulation with an embedded iframe viewer
- Customizable bookmarks and quick links
- Optional sparkling background and ambient caf√© audio

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to launch Kona Browser. Everything runs client-side, so no build step is required.

## Development notes

- Placeholder images use [placehold.co](https://placehold.co) and can be replaced with official Konata artwork when available.
- Audio sourced from Pixabay's royalty-free collection for optional ambience.
- Settings, bookmarks, and theme preferences persist using `localStorage`.

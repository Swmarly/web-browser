# Task: Silence Test on iOS and Create Bug/CL

# This task can be generalized but is currently specialized for silencing tests for the iOS platform.

You are an expert iOS gardener for the Chromium project. Your task is to silence
a failing or flaky test, create a Buganizer issue, and optionally upload a
changelist (CL) with the fix.

**The user's command is appended below your instructions.** It will contain the
test name, the silencing type (`DISABLED` or `FLAKY`), and optional conditions.

## Workflow:

1.  **Parse Arguments:**

    *   Identify the required `<test_name>`, required `<silencing_type>`
        (`DISABLED` or `FLAKY`), and optional `<conditions>` from the user's
        input.
    *   Example input: `/cr:ios:silence-test testMyFeature FLAKY only on iphone
        device`
    *   **If you can't parse all the required arguments:** Do not proceed with
        this task and print out the missing arguments to the user.

2.  **Locate and read the Test File:**

    *   Use codesearch to find the file containing the `<test_name>`. Do not use
        any language filter which are too strict.
    *   Separate the test suite name in 2 distinct search items from the test
        suite name when doing your search. Example: TestSuite/testCase =>
        "TestSuite", "testCase".

3.  **Determine and Apply Silencing Strategy:**

    *   Based on the file content and user-provided `<conditions>`, choose the
        correct silencing method.
    *   **For Objective-C/C++ (`.mm`, `.cc`):**

        *   **No Conditions:** Rename the test by adding the `<silencing_type>_`
            prefix.
            *   `TEST_F(MySuite, testMyFeature)` -> `TEST_F(MySuite,
                <silencing_type>_testMyFeature)`
            *   `- (void)testMyFeature` -> `-
                (void)<silencing_type>_testMyFeature`
            *   **Important for Objective-C instance methods:** If the test
                method is referenced by a `@selector`, you MUST also update the
                selector to match the new test name (e.g.,
                `@selector(testMyFeature)` ->
                `@selector(<silencing_type>_testMyFeature)`). Search for usages
                of the selector in the same file. Be aware of linebreaks in the
                @selector statement where something like
                `@selector(\ntestMyFeature)` is possible where the code is split
                into multiple lines.
        *   **With Conditions (e.g., "iphone device", "ipad simulator", "no
            multiwindow"):**

            *   **Compile-time conditions for tests on iOS (e.g., simulator vs.
                device):** Rename the test to `MAYBE_testMyFeature` and add a
                preprocessor block. For "iphone device": `objectivec #if
                !TARGET_OS_SIMULATOR #define MAYBE_testMyFeature
                DISABLED_testMyFeature #else #define MAYBE_testMyFeature
                testMyFeature #endif`.
            *   **Runtime conditions (e.g., OS version, form factor,
                multi-window):** Add a guard at the beginning of the test
                method.

                *   **OS Version:** `if (@available(iOS <os_version>, *)) {
                    EARL_GREY_TEST_SKIPPED(@"Reason"); }`
                *   **Starting from an iOS version and beyond:**
                    `base::ios::IsRunningOnIOS<os_version>OrLater() {
                    EARL_GREY_TEST_SKIPPED(@"Reason");}`.

                    Pick one of the helpers in @base/ios/ios_util.mm. Replace
                    the <os_version> by the OS version to start silencing from
                    (e.g. IsRunningOnIOS26OrLater() for silencing the test when
                    running on iOS 26 or later). Commit
                    afc85ffeb6f263217e983d0c5cf2f4e2d4af50d5 shows an example of
                    that.

                *   **Screen width:** `if ([ChromeEarlGrey isCompactWidth]) {
                    EARL_GREY_TEST_SKIPPED(@"Reason"); }`.

                *   **Type of device (iphone or ipad):** `if ([ChromeEarlGrey
                    isIPadIdiom]) { EARL_GREY_TEST_SKIPPED(@"Reason"); }`

                *   **Multi-window:** `if (![ChromeEarlGrey
                    areMultipleWindowsSupported]) {
                    EARL_GREY_TEST_DISABLED(@"Reason"); }`

    *   **For Java (`.java`):**

        *   Add the `@DisabledTest(message = "crbug.com/...")` annotation above
            the test method. You will need to create a bug first to get the bug
            number.

4.  **Create a Bug iff needed:**

    *   Search for an existing bug for the test case before creating a new one.
    *   Create a bug base on this template:
        *   **Title:** `[iOS Gardener] Test <test_name> failing on waterfall
            <bot_name>`
        *   **Description:** "Disabling flaky test `<test_name>` to keep the
            tree green. Example: <bot_link>"
        *   Do not add the "Example: <bot_link>" part if you can't get
            <bot_link> from the user prompt.
        *   **Component ID:** Use the default component with id 1363614 if not
            provided.
        *   **Hotlists:** Add the 5432803 (Test-Disabled) hotlist id.
        *   **Priority:** P1
        *   **Type:** Task
        *   **Bug Template:**: 1923683
    *   Add TODO task comment with that bug id on top of the silenced test.

5.  **Make the code changes:**

    *   Switch to a new branch: `git new-branch
        gardener/disable-test-<test_name>-<bug_id>` Do not use a branch name
        that exceeds 20 characters so feel free to shorten the `<test_name>` if
        needed.
    *   If there are already active code changes in the working tree, use `git
        freeze` to temporarily commit those changes in the current git branch
        before switching.
    *   Apply the silencing change to the test file.
    *   Make sure that the needed headers are included.
    *   If there are missing dependencies in the BUILD.gn file, add them.
    *   Format the changes with `git cl format`.
    *   Add the file to git and commit the change. The commit message should be:
        ``` [iOS][Gardener] Disable flaky test <test_name>

        Bug: <bug_id> ```

        `<bug_id>` is the bug that you have created for silencing the test.

        It is **REALLY IMPORTANT** to include the `Bug: <bug_id>` line in the
        commit message.

6.  **(Optional) Create and Upload a CL:**

    *   First, ask the user if they want to upload the changelist for review. Do
        not upload a cl if the answer is no.
    *   If yes, upload for review: `git cl upload -f -d -m "..."`

Execute these steps methodically. Ask for clarification if any of the user's
inputs are ambiguous.

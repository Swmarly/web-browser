description = "Generate browser tests for a diff from trunk"
prompt = """
Please generate browser tests that cover all new C++ code paths added by this
diff:

```diff
!{git diff --cached origin/main '*.h' '*.cc' ':!*test.cc'}
```

Steps:
1. Look for files ending in `_browsertest.cc` in each relevant directory to
   house the new tests.
2. Read each test file to understand existing test cases, fixtures, helper
   methods, and mocks. To familiarize yourself with browser test APIs, you
   should also read:
    * `//content/public/test/browser_test_base.h`
    * `//content/public/test/browser_test_utils.h`
    * `//content/public/test/content_browser_test.h`
3. Decide where test coverage should go:
    * Cosmetic changes or internal refactoring don't require test changes.
    * Sometimes, it's easier to add assertions to existing test cases instead
      of devising new ones (for example, checking a new member on a class).
    * Updating existing tests might also be necessary to capture changes to
      production logic.
4. Add or update the cases in each test file:
    * Any new test cases should resemble existing cases.
    * Do not modify production code.
    * To test boolean expressions, always use `ASSERT_TRUE(...)` instead of
      `ASSERT_EQ(true, ...)` (and likewise for preferring `ASSERT_FALSE(...)`,
      `EXPECT_TRUE(...)`, and `EXPECT_FALSE(...)`).
    * Consult `//third_party/googletest/src/docs/reference/assertions.md` for
      details about assertions.
5. Run `git cl format`.
6. Validate the new changes with `//tools/autotest.py`.

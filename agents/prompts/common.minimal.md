# Gemini-CLI Specific Directives

Instructions that apply only to gemini-cli.

* When using the `read_file` tool:
  * Always set the 'limit' parameter to 20000 to prevent truncation.
* File Not Found Errors:
  * If a file operation fails due to an incorrect path, do not retry with the
    same path.
  * Inform the user and search for the correct path using parts of the path or
    filename.

# Common Directives

Instructions that are useful for chromium development, and not specific to a
single agentic tool.

## Paths

* All files in chromiumâ€™s source can be read by substituting `chromium/src` or
  `//` for the current workspace (which can be determined by running `gclient
  root` and appending `/src` to the output).

## Building

* Do not attempt a build without first establishing the correct output
  directory and target. If you have not been given them, and you plan on doing
  a build, then stop and ask before starting on any other tasks.
* Unless otherwise instructed, build with: `autoninja --quiet -C {OUT_DIR} {TARGET}`
  * If given an `autoninja` command that is missing `--quiet`, add `--quiet`.

## Testing

Unless otherwise instructed, run tests with:
`tools/autotest.py --quiet --run-all -C {OUT_DIR} {RELEVANT_TEST_FILENAMES}`

When using `tools/autotest.py`:
* Do not invoke `autoninja` beforehand because `autotest.py` automatically
  builds relevant targets.
* Build targets containing colons (`:`) are not valid inputs for
  `{RELEVANT_TEST_FILENAMES}`.

## Coding

* Stay on task: Do not address code health issues or TODOs in code unless it is
  required to achieve your given task.
* Add code comments sparingly: Focus on *why* something is done, not *what* is
  done.

## Presubmit Checks

When you have finished validating your changes through other means, run:

```sh
git cl format
git cl presubmit -u --force
```
* Fix errors / warnings related to your change, but do not fix pre-existing
  warnings (from lines that you did not change).

## JNI

Chrome on Android uses both Java and C++ frequently. Our JNI uses codegen from
`//third_party/jni_zero`.

Identifying JNI methods:
  * In Java, methods annotated with `@CalledByNative` are called by C++.
    * In C++, these appear as methods with a "Java_" prefix.
  * In Java, methods within interfaces annotated with `@NativeMethods` are calls
    into C++.
    * In C++, these appear as methods with a "JNI_" prefix.
    * If the first parameter is of type `long` and has a prefix of "native",
      then it maps to a method of the same name on the C++ class that comes
      after the "native" prefix. Eg. `void foo(long nativeBarImpl)` means you
      need to find `BarImpl::Foo` in C++.

Finding JNI methods:
  * To find the Java side of JNI: search for the file named `{JavaClass}.java`
    (where {JavaClass} is taken from the `#include "{JavaClass}_jni.h"`.
  * To find the C++ side of JNI: Search for the text `{JavaClass}_jni.h` in C++
    files (where {JavaClass} is taken from the .java file name).

When making changes to JNI methods, always make changes to both the .java and
.cc/.h files involved.

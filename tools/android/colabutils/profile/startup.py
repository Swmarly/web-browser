    This function ensures the app is stopped, performs a cold start, while
    recording a trace and then queries the trace for the histogram value.

    Args:
        app: The chrome.App object with which to start and stop chrome
        url: The URL to launch the Chrome with.
        trace_file: An optional `trace.TraceFile` object to store the trace.
                    If not provided, a temporary file will be created.
        trace_config: An optional path to a Perfetto trace config file.
                      If not provided, a default config is used.

    Returns:
        The cold startup time in milliseconds.

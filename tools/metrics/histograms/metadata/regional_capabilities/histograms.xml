<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.ActiveRegionalProgram2"
    enum="ActiveRegionalProgram" expires_after="2026-04-05">
  <owner>ljjlee@google.com</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Records an overall active regional program for the profiles loaded in the
    current session, at the time the session is finalized. This histogram will
    be used by the UMA pipeline to tag all metrics in the session log, enabling
    per-program filtering and analysis.

    Emitted through ProvideCurrentSessionData, when a UMA session record is
    getting finalized.
  </summary>

<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.Debug.ProgramSpecificExclusion"
    enum="RegionalProgramSpecificExclusion" expires_after="2026-03-01">
  <owner>dgn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Reports occurrences of some of program specific conditions for which we
    don't have some dedicated histogram, but want to monitor for debugging
    purposes. See the individual events for record timing.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.FallbackCountryMatching"
    enum="CountryMatchingStatus" expires_after="2026-03-01">
  <owner>dgn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Reports on the relative status of the fallback profile country and the Finch
    latest country.

    Recorded when the profile is loaded, when we failed fetching the country
    from the primary source (e.g. Finch or Play). This can commonly happen
    during the FRE for some platforms. Otherwise,
    RegionalCapabilities.FetchedCountryMatching is recorded.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.FetchedCountryMatching"
    enum="CountryMatchingStatus" expires_after="2026-03-01">
  <owner>dgn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Reports on the relative status of the fetched profile country and the Finch
    latest country.

    Recorded when the profile is loaded, when we succeeded fetching the country
    from the primary source (e.g. Finch or Play). Otherwise,
    RegionalCapabilities.FallbackCountryMatching is recorded.
  </summary>

<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.FunnelStage.Eligibility"
    enum="SearchEngineChoiceScreenConditions" expires_after="2026-08-19">
  <owner>dgn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>ljjlee@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the condition state on profile load for whether the profile is
    possibly eligible for a search engine choice screen.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.FunnelStage.RegionalPresence"
    enum="RegionalProgramAndLocationMatch" expires_after="2026-03-29">
  <owner>dgn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Reports on the relative status of the profile country and the Finch latest
    country, in the context of the selected regional program.

    Recorded when the profile is loaded, for profiles that have been determined
    to be in-scope for a non-default program. Only one bucket is logged for a
    profile, the most specific one. This means that &quot;region matches&quot;
    is not logged when &quot;country matches&quot; is logged.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.FunnelStage.Reported"
    enum="RegionalCapabilitiesFunnelStage" expires_after="2026-03-22">
  <owner>dgn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Reports on which stage of the regional capabilities funnel a given profile
    is in. (Internal-only: see go/chrome-taiyaki-metrics-dd for more info)

    Can be recorded by profiles on some key events like profile load or attempt
    to trigger a choice screen.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.FunnelStage.Triggering"
    enum="SearchEngineChoiceScreenConditions" expires_after="2026-08-19">
  <owner>dgn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>ljjlee@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the condition state at choice screen triggering attempt, for whether
    we are determining the profile to be eligible for a search engine choice
    screen. This is recorded every time the dynamic eligibility state is being
    checked, which might be as often as every page navigation on desktop, or app
    warm open on iOS. If a profile was deemed ineligible a profile load time (as
    recorded by the RegionalCapabilities.FunnelStage.Eligibility histogram),
    this histogram will not be recorded.
  </summary>

<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.LoadedCountrySource"
    enum="LoadedCapabilitiesCountrySource" expires_after="2026-03-01">
  <owner>dgn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Reports which source of information is used by a given profile to determine
    the regional capabilities country.

    Recorded on each profile load.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="RegionalCapabilities.PersistedCountryMatching"
    enum="CountryMatchingStatus" expires_after="2026-03-01">
  <owner>dgn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>chrome-regionalcapabilities@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Reports on the relative status of the persisted profile country and the
    Finch latest country.

    Recorded on each profile load.

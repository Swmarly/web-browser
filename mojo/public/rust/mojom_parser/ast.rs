//! Provides a generic syntax for Mojom types and values
//!
//! This module provides the ability to represent Mojom types and values as
//! rust enums.

// FOR_RELEASE: The current AST is dead simple: standard recursive data
// structures. We'll probably need an intermediate one as well to represent data
// on the wire, since it doesn't quite match the MojomValue structure (e.g.
// packed bitfields). For a more optimized version, we should look into:
// - Flat ASTs (using a single vector instead of a nested recursive structure
// - Mapping between these and rust types that are created by the bindings
//   generator
// - Some way to mark fields that doesn't rely on using strings to tag them.
// - For example, using fixed-length arrays indexed by by the field's ordinal.
//   This is much less intuitive, though, so it should wait until we're certain
//   things are already working.

/// Representation of a type that can appear in a .mojom file.
///
/// These include the primitive types from
/// public/tools/bindings/README.md#Primitive-Types, as well as non-primitive
/// types like structs and enums.
// FOR_RELEASE: Not all types are currently supported, and we won't support all of them
// for the initial release, but we'll need at least these plus enums and nullables.

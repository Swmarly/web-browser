Description:
Oak is a software platform for building distributed systems providing externally
verifiable (or falsifiable) claims about system behaviors in a transparent way.

Oak provides building blocks that are used to build Enclave Applications,
i.e. applications that are isolated from the host on which they run, and are
remotely attestable.

Local Modifications:
Added the "chromium_types/" directory. This directory contains the following
wire-compatible equivalents of the full protobuf versions:
- `any.proto`
- `timestamp.proto`

These are needed because Chromium uses `protobuf_lite`, which does
not include these files, and including the full protobuf library is not
feasible due to its size. This approach of copying needed protos is a common
practice within Chromium. All other protocol buffers are unchanged.

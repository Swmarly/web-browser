Chromium maintains a mirror of the official SQLite Git repository at
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/deps/sqlite. Generally the stock
upstream release branch is used, but occasionally unreleased upstream bug
fixes are backported to the release branch.

The SQLite homepage is https://sqlite.org/.

When rolling a new version of protobuf-javascript, update the js_proto library
in the BUILD.gn file in //third_party/protobuf with newly added/removed files
from this project.

As far as I know, you can do this by looking at the `git diff --stat
<cur_rev>..<new_rev>` and noting files that have been added or removed.

Description:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/mini_chromium/
mini_chromium is a small collection of useful low-level (“base”) routines from
the Chromium open-source project at https://www.chromium.org/Home. Chromium is
large, sprawling, full of dependencies, and a web browser. mini_chromium is
small, self-contained, and a library. mini_chromium is especially useful as a
dependency of other code that wishes to use Chromium’s base routines.

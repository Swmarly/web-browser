Description:
WirePlumber is a modular session / policy manager for PipeWire and a GObject-based high-level
library that wraps PipeWire's API, providing convenience for writing the daemon's
modules as well as external tools for managing PipeWire. The WirePlumber daemon implements the
session & policy management service. It follows a modular design, having plugins that implement
the actual management functionality.

This contains a 3pp description used to build a CIPD package of the above code.
This package is used only by WebRTC to test PipeWire code.

Local Modifications:
A patch removing use of gettid() used only for debug purpose to avoid a build failure on undefined
reference.

This package will be only pulled in to CIPD and not into chromium/src.
